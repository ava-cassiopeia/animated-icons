# Overview

Animated icons is a vanilla custom elements implementation of several animated
icons that you can choose to import into your site in order to have these 
animations as a part of your UI.

## Setup

See the [GitHub readme](https://github.com/aeolingamenfel/animated-icons) for 
more information on installing and setting up the icons to be used in your 
project.

## Triggering Animation

Unless otherwise noted, icons do not animate automatically. Instead, you can 
trigger the animation by either adding the `animate` attribute to the icon 
element, **or** by calling the `.animate()` method on a reference to the icon
element.

In addition, you can reset the animation by removing the attribute or calling
the `.reset()` method on a reference to the icon element.

Each icon has unique configuration information and APIs that you can use to 
color them and change parts of their animations. See the icon demo link above 
to preview each icon, or see below for more specific information on each icon.
